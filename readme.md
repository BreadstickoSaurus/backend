## Backend Project
> Deno

This is the backend part of the game collection platform.  
It includes all the required endpoints for the relative frontend project.
- working with an endpoint-controller-repository style
- all endpoints have a check for their input and give an appropriate error result
- port is set in the WebApiModule.ts and can be changed if needed(dont forget to check the frontend)
